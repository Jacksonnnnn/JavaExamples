2. Add scanner variable
	-> Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

3. Ask something for the user
	-> How old are you?
	
4. Enter your method type
	-> double age = scanner.nextDouble();

5. Use the variable any way you want
	-> 	void dogYears(age) {
			//Since 1 year for is is 7 years for dogs, your dog age will be calculated!
			int dogAge;
			dogAge = age * 7;
		
			System.out.println("Your age in dog years is " + dogAge + " years old.");
		}
		dogYears(age);
